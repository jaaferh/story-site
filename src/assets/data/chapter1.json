        "But though the colours they form may be different,",

        "A new gust twirls the air.",
        "My pen dancing on the striped white floor.",
        "A unique pattern of an exotic blossom crashes into my garden.",
        "With broken petals and wilted stems,",
        "The fresh buds smile at me as they awake delighted.",

        "I look at my paper, streaks on the floor from the dancer's shoes,",
        "Scratches and lines among symbols and signs.",
        "My eyes adjust to the novelty I've written,",
        "And a smile grows on my face as a new adventure begins:",
        "I must conquer these strange winds that greet me,",

        "So that I can show you a perfect garden when we meet again."
